Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is the most populated city in the world. For the first time in Bangladesh, 
an international AI-based Dhaka Traffic Detection Challenge funded by Elsevier was held during STI 2020. 
We participated in this challenge and secured 29th position. This repo contains all the google colab notebooks we used
